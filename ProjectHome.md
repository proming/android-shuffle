## Introduction ##

Thanks for checking out Shuffle, a personal organizational tool, styled around the _**Getting Things Done**_ methodology. Shuffle is a dumping ground for ideas and tasks. It lets you rapidly create and organize your actions, relieving you of the stress of trying to remember everything you need to get done. Since Shuffle is a mobile application, you will have it with you where ever you are. You can always add an idea you've just had, or quickly check what's on the top of your list of actions.

A simple elegant workflow encourages you to categorize your actions into projects and optionally provide a context. This structure lets you to break down formidable projects into individual achievable actions.  As a project evolves over time, you can clean out old actions as they're performed, add new actions and reorder any remaining actions depending on your current priorities.

## Bugs, Feature Requests, Feedback and Contributing ##

I'm currently employed full time (unrelated to Shuffle and Android) and have a baby girl under one, so am not setting aside much time for after-hours coding.

If you have a bug or feature request, please consider using this site to either add a comment to an existing issue or create a new one. http://code.google.com/p/android-shuffle/issues/list

I do look at this list, and take it into account when considering what new features or bugs to work on next. However for long outstanding much requested features like repeating tasks and alerts I haven't tackled these yet, as they would require several days dedicated work, and I simply haven't got that much spare time currently. I do hope to get to these features some day, but don't hold your breath waiting. :-)

I have also had very little involvement in the Tracks integration. If your query is regarding this, consider contacting Morten (morten@morkeleb.com). Like me, he is working full-time and has precious little time recently to spend on Shuffle.

If you would like to contribute, first off thank you for your interest. Check out the source code and have a bash at adding that killer feature you really want. Then submit it as a [patch](http://ariejan.net/2007/07/03/how-to-create-and-apply-a-patch-with-subversion/). Let me know first hand if you're planning on tackling something substantial though. I might be working on it already, or have some ideas on how it should be done.

Kind regards,
Andy Bryant
